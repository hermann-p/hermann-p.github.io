This blog
=======

This blog is meant for me to keep myself motivated following my side projects by
semi-regularly keeping track of progress.

The author
=======

I am a computational scientist from southern Germany. I've been programming
in different languages since 1996, with serious education starting in 2002.
My university education includes English, maths, statistics, physics, genomics
and bioinformatics, computer science, and biology.

I specialize in parallel processing, algorithms, and (genomic) data analysis.
My private projects show tendencies towards gaming and mobile apps, and I love
to explore in code what intrigues me -- be it new technologies, ideas or 
concepts.

I am a firm believer in open standards and encourage open source and free
access to research data and results, but I understand that in some cases the
need for closed projects may arise.

## Programming languages I can handle and use regularly:

* Java (since 2000)
* Clojure/ClojureScript (since 2015, my current favorite)
* C (Since 2005, teaching it at university since 2012)
* Python (since 2010, teaching it at university since 2014)
* C++ (since 1999)
* Fortran (since 2013)
* JavaScript (you can't avoid touching it, can you?)
* Unix shell

## The forgotten ones

* Basic
* Excel
* Turbo Pascal
* Ocaml
* MS-DOS batch commands
